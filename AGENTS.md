Please look at README.md. Note that skills are located in .github/skills, check when to use skills before deciding what to do (usage of skills may be implicit by wording of instructions, e.g. "generate plan"). some vendor docs may be located in vendor-docs/, but if not, use model knowledge. 

Ignore the TODOS.md file
