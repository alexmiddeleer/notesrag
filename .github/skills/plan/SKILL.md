## Steps 
 
0. If user requests an update to the existing plan, just proceed as instructed (update the plan.md file as requested). Review the plan and make necessary updates, and report any concerns (contradictions, odd choices, inconsistencies) back to the user as warnings. Then stop.
 
1. If user requests a new plan, and plan.md (root of project) already exists move it to .archives with a timestamp.

2. Create path.md (root of project) and populate it by analyzing user's request and project context to generate a detailed plan for work to be done. Contents may include, but are not limited to:

   - Overview of the plan
   - Steps to be taken
   - Questions user should answer before starting ( Put **Answer: ** after each question for user to fill in)
